**Road Accident Detection and Emergency Alert Framework**_
Project Summary

The Road Accident Detection and Emergency Alert Framework is an intelligent monitoring system built to automatically recognize road accidents from live camera footage, generate immediate alerts, and assist in mobilizing emergency services. By combining computer vision, automated alerts, and communication APIs, the project aims to minimize response delays and enhance road safety outcomes.

Core Highlights

Automated Detection: Leverages real-time video analytics using OpenCV to identify unusual vehicular movements and collision patterns that indicate accidents.

Instant Notifications: Produces a warning sound the moment an accident is detected, alerting nearby personnel or control centers.

Incident Logging: Automatically captures and saves an image of the detected event along with precise timestamps for record-keeping and investigation.

Emergency Connectivity: Integrated with the Twilio API to initiate emergency calls or messages, allowing rapid coordination with medical or rescue teams.

Technology Stack

Computer Vision: Implemented with OpenCV for frame analysis and anomaly recognition.

Model Integration: Custom-trained models using Keras/TensorFlow to enhance detection precision.

Audio Engine: Python-based libraries used for real-time alert sound generation.

Communication Module: Twilio for sending automated SMS or call notifications.

Code Management: Version control and collaboration maintained through GitHub.
